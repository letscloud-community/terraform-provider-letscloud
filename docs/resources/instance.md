# letscloud_instance (Resource)

Manages a LetsCloud instance. This resource allows you to create, update, and delete instances in LetsCloud.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# First, create an SSH key
resource "letscloud_ssh_key" "main" {
  label = "main-key"
  key   = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
}

# Then create the instance
resource "letscloud_instance" "basic" {
  label         = "basic-instance"
  plan_slug     = "1vcpu-1gb-10ssd"
  image_slug    = "ubuntu-24.04-x86_64"
  location_slug = "MIA1"
  hostname      = "basic-instance.example.com"
  ssh_keys      = [letscloud_ssh_key.main.id]
  password      = "P@ssw0rd123!Secure" # Must be 12-32 chars with uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special char
  depends_on    = [letscloud_ssh_key.main]
}
```

## Password Requirements

The password must meet the following requirements:
- Length: 12-32 characters
- Must contain at least one uppercase letter
- Must contain at least one lowercase letter
- Must contain at least one digit
- Must contain at least one special character (!@#$*-+_={}\/)
- Cannot contain characters like %"<>|^&()

## Available Plans

Common plan slugs include:
- `1vcpu-1gb-10ssd`: 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 10GB SSD
- `2vcpu-2gb-20ssd`: 2 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 20GB SSD
- `4vcpu-4gb-40ssd`: 4 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 40GB SSD

## Available Locations

Common location slugs include:
- `MIA1`: Miami, USA
- `NYC1`: New York, USA
- `LAX1`: Los Angeles, USA

## Available Images

Common image slugs include:
- `ubuntu-24.04-x86_64`: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- `ubuntu-22.04-x86_64`: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- `debian-12-x86_64`: Debian 12

## Best Practices

1. **Instance Naming**:
   - Use descriptive labels and hostnames
   - Follow a consistent naming convention
   - Include environment information (e.g., dev, prod)

2. **Security**:
   - Always use SSH keys for secure access
   - Follow password requirements strictly
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Consider using multiple SSH keys for different access levels

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Choose appropriate plan sizes based on workload
   - Monitor instance usage and adjust resources as needed
   - Use appropriate locations based on your users' locations

## Notes

- Instance creation may take a few minutes
- The instance will be accessible via both IPv4 and IPv6
- SSH access is available immediately after instance creation
- The instance state will be "active" when ready for use
