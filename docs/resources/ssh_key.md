# letscloud_ssh_key (Resource)

Manages an SSH key in LetsCloud. SSH keys are used to securely access your instances without using passwords.
Note: Updates to existing SSH keys are not supported by the LetsCloud API.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage
```hcl
resource "letscloud_ssh_key" "main" {
  label = "main-key"
  key   = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
}
```

### Using with an Instance
```hcl
# Create the SSH key
resource "letscloud_ssh_key" "main" {
  label = "main-key"
  key   = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
}

# Create an instance using the SSH key
resource "letscloud_instance" "basic" {
  label         = "basic-instance"
  plan_slug     = "1vcpu-1gb-10ssd"
  image_slug    = "ubuntu-24.04-x86_64"
  location_slug = "MIA1"
  hostname      = "basic-instance.example.com"
  ssh_keys      = [letscloud_ssh_key.main.id]
  password      = "P@ssw0rd123!Secure"
  depends_on    = [letscloud_ssh_key.main]
}
```

### Using Multiple SSH Keys
```hcl
resource "letscloud_ssh_key" "admin" {
  label = "admin-key"
  key   = file("~/.ssh/admin.pub")
}

resource "letscloud_ssh_key" "developer" {
  label = "developer-key"
  key   = file("~/.ssh/developer.pub")
}

resource "letscloud_instance" "example" {
  # ... other fields ...
  ssh_keys = [
    letscloud_ssh_key.admin.id,
    letscloud_ssh_key.developer.id
  ]
}
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Key Format**: 
   - Use RSA keys with at least 2048 bits or Ed25519 keys for better security
   - Ensure your public key is in the correct format (starts with `ssh-rsa` or `ssh-ed25519`)

2. **Key Management**: 
   - Store private keys securely and never commit them to version control
   - Use different keys for different environments (development, staging, production)
   - Rotate keys periodically
   - Use descriptive labels to track key purposes

3. **Access Control**: 
   - Remove unused keys
   - Limit the number of keys with access to each instance
   - Use unique labels for each key

## Notes

- The SSH key must be in the public key format (e.g., starting with `ssh-rsa`, `ssh-ed25519`, etc.)
- The key should be the complete public key, including the key type and comment
- Once created, SSH keys cannot be updated - you must delete and recreate them
- The label must be unique within your account
- When using with instances, make sure to use `depends_on` to ensure the SSH key is created first

## Schema

### Required

- `key` (String, Sensitive) The public SSH key. Must be in the correct format (e.g., starting with ssh-rsa, ssh-ed25519, etc.).
- `label` (String) A unique label for the SSH key. Used for identification and should be descriptive of the key's purpose.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the SSH key.
